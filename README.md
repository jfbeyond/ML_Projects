# ML_Projects
This repository will contain different applications of ML. It will be updated as I work on different projects using different classification algorithms.

Each one of the projects will be presented in a jupyter notebook with comments describing the flow of the analysis and solution.

NOTE: The projects come from Udemy course: Machine Learning Practical: 6 Real-world applications
